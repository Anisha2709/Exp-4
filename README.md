# Exp - 4 HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To model and automate hospital management system operations using UML diagrams in StarUML.

# SRS (Procedure):
### Step 1: Problem Identification  
Identify inefficiencies in manual hospital operations, including patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, and billing processes.

### Step 2: Requirement Analysis  
Define user roles (Patient, Doctor, Nurse, Admin, Receptionist) and specify core functions such as patient registration, appointment booking, diagnosis recording, prescription management, billing, and report generation.

### Step 3: System Design  
Develop UML diagrams (Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, Package) in StarUML and design database tables for patients, doctors, appointments, medical records, prescriptions, and billing.
